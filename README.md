Personal Notes Week Two 

- The passage introduces the `img` element, which is fundamental for adding images to webpages, highlighting its importance in enhancing visual appeal and conveying information effectively. 

- It emphasizes the significance of four key attributes associated with the `img` element: `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height`. 

- `src` attribute: This attribute specifies the image file to be loaded by the browser, defining the image's source location. 

- `alt` attribute: Described as crucial for accessibility, `alt` provides alternative text that describes the image for users who may not be able to see it, such as those utilizing screen readers. It stresses the importance of making this description meaningful and engaging, while also noting the option to leave it blank if the image doesn't convey significant information. 

- The passage offers guidance on crafting `alt` text, suggesting descriptions like "a shiny black dog appearing pensive," which adds flavor and context to the image without explicitly stating it's a photo. 

- It also addresses situations where leaving the `alt` attribute blank is preferable, such as when repetitive or unnecessary descriptions might disrupt the user experience. 

- `width` and `height` attributes: These attributes determine the size of the image, specified in pixels. The passage underscores that including these attributes is essential for optimizing page layout and preventing disruptive shifts during page loading. 

- It explains that specifying the dimensions of images allows browsers to calculate layout more efficiently, improving the user experience by reducing instances where the page shifts as images load. 

- Additionally, the passage clarifies that the order of attributes within the `img` element is flexible, highlighting HTML's flexibility in attribute arrangement. 

- The passage provides rationale for including width and height attributes despite the apparent redundancy after the image loads, emphasizing their role in providing browsers with advance information for layout calculation, thus minimizing disruption to the user experience. 

- Overall, the passage serves as a comprehensive guide to working with images in web development, covering both technical considerations (attributes) and user experience principles (accessibility and layout optimization). - The passage discusses the importance of choosing the appropriate image file format for web use, balancing visual quality with file size for faster downloads and reduced data usage. 

- It introduces four main image formats commonly used on the web: GIF, SVG, JPG, and PNG, each with its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of compression. 

- GIF: Suitable for compressing illustrations with large areas of the same color but may result in pixelation for photographs due to its limited color support (256 colors). GIFs can have transparent areas but may exhibit jagged edges. 

- SVG: Ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations, SVG is a vector file format that allows scaling to any size without loss of quality. It contains drawing instructions rather than pixels, resulting in small file sizes. SVG files can be exported from graphic design software like Illustrator or Sketch. 

- JPG: Commonly used for compressing photographs, JPG format requires appropriate resizing and compression to avoid slowing down webpage loading. Compression techniques include reducing color information while balancing quality and file size. Web services can assist in this process. 

- PNG: Suitable for images requiring transparency, PNG format may outperform GIF and JPG in certain scenarios. Experimentation with compression settings is recommended to achieve the smallest file size. The passage hints at the possibility of new image formats emerging in the future.

- It highlights the drawbacks of universally reducing image sizes, which may compromise image quality on large screens while benefiting smaller screens. 

- HTML's `srcset` attribute allows developers to deliver different image files to screens of varying sizes, improving user experience by optimizing image quality and download speeds. 

- The basic code for loading an image on a webpage includes an `img` element with a `src` attribute pointing to the image file, along with `alt` text, width, and height attributes. 

- To support different screen resolutions (e.g., 1X, 2X, 3X), developers create multiple copies of an image with different resolutions and inform the browser about these options using the `srcset` attribute. 

- Each entry in the `srcset` attribute includes a URL to the file and resolution information, allowing the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on factors like screen density, network connection, and user settings. 

- The passage demonstrates this technique by providing four copies of a photo at different widths (480, 960, 1440, and 1920 pixels) and instructs developers to duplicate the basic HTML code for displaying the image, including the `src` attribute for the 1X version and adding the `srcset` attribute to provide browser choices. 

- This technique is particularly useful for handling different image sizes for high-resolution screens like retina displays and high DPI screens. 

- The passage hints at the next step of adjusting image sizes based on page layout or width, suggesting further optimization strategies for responsive web design. - The passage introduces a refinement to the previous technique of using the `srcset` attribute by specifying image widths (e.g., "480w" for 480 pixels wide, "960w" for 960 pixels wide) instead of pixel densities. 

- The browser selects the appropriate image based on device density and viewport width, enhancing the adaptability of images to various screen sizes and resolutions. 

- However, there is a potential issue where the chosen image may not fit the desired layout, as the browser makes this decision early in the loading process without knowing the CSS or layout details. 

- To address this, developers can use the `sizes` attribute in HTML to specify which image to use at different breakpoints, providing the browser with more information to make better choices. 

- The `sizes` attribute allows developers to specify how much of the viewport's width the image will occupy at each breakpoint, ensuring the browser downloads the right-sized image for the layout. 

- By including this information in the HTML, developers assist the browser in making intelligent decisions considering network conditions and user preferences, improving overall user experience. - The passage introduces the concept of the `picture` element as a solution for displaying images differently on various screen sizes, addressing the limitations of using the `img` element alone, especially for responsive design needs. 

- It begins by explaining the setup with the `img` element, ensuring compatibility with older browsers like Internet Explorer 11, and then introduces the `picture` element as a wrapper for the image setup. 

- Within the `picture` element, alternative options are listed using the `source` element. Two options are provided: one for mobile screens and another for larger screens. 

- The first `source` element utilizes the `srcset` attribute to point to a mobile image file, sized at 320 pixels wide, ensuring it's loaded when the viewport is smaller than 600 pixels. 

- The second `source` element employs a media query to specify the image for larger screens, loading the landscape version of the photo when the viewport is at least 600 pixels wide. 

- The passage highlights the versatility of the `source set` attribute, which is used in both the `img` element and the `source` element within the `picture` element, allowing for efficient image optimization across different screen sizes. 

- It emphasizes the main purpose of using these HTML techniques: to send the smallest file possible while still delivering high-quality images tailored to various screen sizes. 

- Despite the potential complexity involved in creating multiple image files, the passage reassures that on most websites, this process is automated, with server robots generating necessary image files and writing code based on instructions from content contributors. 

- The effort invested in optimizing images pays off in terms of data savings, with the example demonstrating a significant difference in file sizes (ranging from 27k to 593k) and potential data savings of three megabytes per page with six photos, making it a worthwhile endeavor for web developers. - The passage introduces the concept of using the `figure` and `figcaption` elements to match captions with images on web pages, providing additional context and semantic meaning to the content. 

- It begins by instructing to display an image of a dog and add a caption using the `figcaption` element, which wraps the text and designates it as a caption. 

- The image and caption are then combined within a `figure` element, providing the browser with more information about the relationship between the image and the caption, enhancing accessibility and search engine understanding. 

- The use of `figure` and `figcaption` elements extends beyond images, as they can also be utilized for other visual elements such as interactive graphics. 

- By incorporating `figure` and `figcaption` elements, developers can convey the relationship between visual content and accompanying text more effectively, improving both user experience and search engine optimization. 

- Overall, `figure` and `figcaption` elements are valuable tools for associating captions with visual content on web pages, ensuring clarity and coherence in presenting information and enhancing understanding for both humans and machines. - The passage introduces the `<audio>` element in HTML, which allows for embedding audio files into web pages. 

- Unlike the `<img>` element for images, the `<audio>` element has both opening and closing tags, offering more flexibility. 

- Developers use the `src` attribute within the `<audio>` element to specify the URL of the audio file, similar to the `src` attribute for images. 

- Adding the `controls` attribute to the `<audio>` element enables browser-provided controls like play, pause, and volume adjustment. 

- Custom audio player controls can be created using JavaScript and the HTML media element API, though this isn't covered in the provided example. 

- Additional attributes like `loop` and `autoplay` control audio playback behavior, allowing for looping or automatic playback upon page load. 

- The `<source>` element within the `<audio>` element allows for specifying multiple audio files, offering fallbacks for different formats or browser compatibility. 

- While MP3 is widely supported, other formats like OGG may be used for compatibility, and developers should understand syntax for supporting multiple formats. 

- Fallback text within the `<audio>` element is displayed if the browser doesn't understand the audio element at all, ensuring a suitable user experience across browsers. 

- Overall, the `<audio>` element enhances the multimedia capabilities of HTML, providing a powerful tool for embedding audio files and players on web pages. - Introduction to HTML video element: The passage discusses how the HTML video element has transformed the way we share and consume multimedia content on the web, including movies, TV shows, and educational materials.
